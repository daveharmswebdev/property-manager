# Agent Customization
# Customize any section below - all are optional

# Override agent name
agent:
  metadata:
    name: ""

# Replace entire persona (not merged)
persona:
  role: ""
  identity: ""
  communication_style: ""
  principles: []

# Add custom critical actions (appended after standard config loading)
critical_actions: []

# Add persistent memories for the agent
memories:
  - "This project uses .NET 10 with Clean Architecture (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Api layers)"
  - "Backend uses MediatR for CQRS pattern - commands and queries are handled by MediatR handlers"
  - "CRITICAL: GlobalExceptionHandlerMiddleware handles all domain exceptions centrally - DO NOT add try-catch blocks in controllers for NotFoundException, ValidationException, etc."
  - "Controllers should be thin - just validate input, call MediatR, return result. Let middleware handle exceptions."
  - "Only use try-catch in controllers when you need CUSTOM exception handling (e.g., returning default value instead of 404)"
  - "Exception mapping: NotFoundException→404, ValidationException→400, ArgumentException→400, UnauthorizedAccessException→403, others→500"
  - "All API error responses use RFC 7807 ProblemDetails format with traceId for correlation"
  - "FluentValidation is used for request validation - validators are called explicitly in controllers before MediatR"
  - "Frontend uses Angular 20+ with @ngrx/signals for state management"
  - "API client is generated from Swagger using NSwag - run 'npm run generate-api' after adding new endpoints"
  - "DEFINITION OF DONE: Dev work is NOT complete until ALL unit tests pass locally - both frontend (npm test) and backend (dotnet test)"
  - "Playwright MCP is available for browser-based testing - use mcp__playwright__ tools when UI testing or verification is needed"
  - "TypeScript LSP plugin is available - use it for type checking, finding references, go-to-definition, and catching type errors in Angular/TypeScript code"
  - "C# LSP plugin is available - use it for type checking, finding references, go-to-definition, and catching compile errors in .NET code"
# Example:
# memories:
#   - "User prefers detailed technical explanations"
#   - "Current project uses React and TypeScript"

# Add custom menu items (appended to base menu)
# Don't include * prefix or help/exit - auto-injected
menu: []
# Example:
# menu:
#   - trigger: my-workflow
#     workflow: "{project-root}/custom/my.yaml"
#     description: My custom workflow

# Add custom prompts (for action="#id" handlers)
prompts: []
# Example:
# prompts:
# - id: my-prompt
#   content: |
#     Prompt instructions here
