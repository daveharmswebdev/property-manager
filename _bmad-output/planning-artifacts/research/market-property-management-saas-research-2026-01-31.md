## Customer Insights

*Scope confirmed by user on 2026-01-31*

### Customer Behavior Patterns

**The "Gap" Segment:**
Target landlords (5-50 properties) occupy a genuine market gap:
- Too big for spreadsheets and manual tracking
- Too small to justify enterprise software ($280+/mo)
- Too busy for a steep learning curve
- Too cost-conscious to overpay for unused features

**Key Statistic:** More than 40% of small landlords still rely on manual tools (spreadsheets, notebooks, random apps) - representing significant untapped market opportunity.

### Pain Points and Challenges

| Pain Point | Customer Feedback |
|------------|-------------------|
| **Software Complexity** | "Dashboards, reports, and automation settings are confusing" |
| **Cost vs. Value** | "If you only own a few units, the cost may feel high compared to value" |
| **Data Migration** | "Moving from spreadsheets into new software is time-consuming" |
| **Support Quality** | "Email and chat support may sometimes be unreliable" - especially on free tiers |
| **Hidden Fees** | Free tools pass costs to tenants (screening fees, transaction fees) |
| **Tenant-Landlord Friction** | Tenants complain about excessive application fees charged by "free" platforms |

### Decision-Making Processes

**DIY vs. Property Manager Inflection Point:**
- 5-10 properties: Self-management viable with good software
- 10-20 properties: Questioning if software alone is sufficient
- Property management companies charge 7-10% of monthly rent (~$140-200/mo per property)
- Good software that saves time extends self-management viability

**Decision Drivers Toward Software:**
- Clear ROI on time saved
- Minimal learning curve required
- Scalability with portfolio growth
- Simplified tax preparation

### Feature Hypothesis Validation

| Feature | Status | Assessment |
|---------|--------|------------|
| **Expense Tracking** | ✅ Non-negotiable | Table stakes - universal feature |
| **Schedule E / Tax Reporting** | ✅ Non-negotiable | Strong competitors exist (Landlord Studio, Baselane, Stessa) |
| **Vendor Management** | ⚠️ **Opportunity** | Weak in affordable tools; strong only in enterprise ($280+/mo) |
| **Work Orders** | ⚠️ **Opportunity** | Same pattern - gap in mid-market solutions |
| **Payment Processing** | ✅ Non-negotiable | Universal feature; fee structures vary |

**Key Insight:** Vendor management + work orders at affordable pricing = potential differentiator. Cheap tools lack these features; expensive tools price out 5-50 unit landlords.

| New entrant with AI | Medium | AI-powered property management emerging |
| Price race to zero | Medium | Many "free" competitors; compete on value not price |

## Executive Summary & Recommendations

### Market Opportunity Assessment

**Market Size:** $3.6B+ growing at 6.4% CAGR
**Target Segment:** 5-50 property landlords (fastest growing at >10% CAGR)
**Untapped Market:** 40%+ of small landlords still using manual tools

### Competitive Position Summary

The 5-50 property segment is served by numerous competitors, but **none fully address the operational needs** of growing landlords at an affordable price point:

- **Financial-focused tools** (Stessa, Baselane, Landlord Studio) excel at expense tracking and tax reporting but lack robust vendor/maintenance management
- **Free tools** (TurboTenant, Avail, Innago) have limitations in reporting, support, or hidden fees
- **Comprehensive tools** (DoorLoop, Buildium) start at $55-69/mo minimum, pricing out small landlords

### Validated Feature Requirements

| Feature | Status | Recommendation |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| Expense Tracking | ✅ Table stakes | Must have |
| Schedule E / Tax Reporting | ✅ Table stakes | Must have, but not differentiator |
| Vendor Management | ⚠️ **Opportunity** | Key differentiator - enterprise tools strong, affordable tools weak |
| Work Orders | ⚠️ **Opportunity** | Key differentiator - same pattern |
| Payment Processing | ✅ Table stakes | Must have |

### Strategic Recommendations

1. **Position as "comprehensive property management for growing landlords"** - Fill the gap between basic free tools and expensive enterprise solutions

2. **Lead with vendor management + work orders** - This is where affordable competitors are weakest; you've already built this

3. **Price in the $15-40/mo range** - Above free tiers (signals value), below DoorLoop's $69 entry point

4. **Target the "spreadsheet graduates"** - Landlords with 5-15 properties outgrowing manual tracking

5. **Emphasize tax-readiness + operational efficiency** - Combine Stessa's financial strength with Innago's operational features

### Risks to Monitor

- Baselane adding maintenance features
- Continued price pressure from free competitors
- AI-powered new entrants
